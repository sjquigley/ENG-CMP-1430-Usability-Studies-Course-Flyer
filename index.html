    <h1>Did you watch <b><em>High Score</em></b> on Netflix?</h1>
    <h2>If so, then you understand how important usability studies are to product design and marketing. If you didn't, well, every episode of <em>High Score</em> details how companies work to establish <em>who</em> their audience is, <em>what</em> they want, and <em>how</em> they will use a given product? Sometimes these questions aren't asked in this order, but at some point, these questions <em>must</em> get asked. Like in episode 2, when Nintendo almost flopped their US release...and they totally would have...had <em>someone</em> not been doing their research.</h2>

    <h1>Usability Testing is Fundamental to <b>ALL</b> Aspects of Product Design</h1>

    <h2>That's right. Any user product, from durable goods to software to online services...even packaging and advertising, go through some kind of testing. In Usability Testing ENGCMP1430 we'll learn the basics of UX (user experience) research by first thinking about user personas and scenarios, then practicing methods for conducting usability studies learning about tools we can use to gather data, and finally thinking about <em>how we might best communicate</em> our findings and data to clients. Along the way, we'll be learning and applying theories of information design and human factors to inform our thinking.</h2>

    <h2>Here is what students say about this course:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I loved that the class was very practical and project–oriented. It made me feel like I was effectively applying what I was learning instead of just doing busy work.</li>
  <li>I liked how this class was very hands–on. I learned the most while working with a real client.</li>
  <li>Steve is one of the few professors who I felt actually took the time to read an entire paper and provide concrete, in–line edits. That was really helpful for me in terms of improving technical writing practices.</li>
